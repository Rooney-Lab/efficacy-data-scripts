# Scripts 

1. `Diversity Indices.R` - remove rares (`vegetation_data_rares.csv`), calculate diversity indices & generate univariate data (`efficacy_univariate.csv`)
2. `Univariate Figures.R` - all the ggplot figures stored in "Figures"; the two figures are panels but you can save each individual plot on its own/can make any figure out of the columns from the data
